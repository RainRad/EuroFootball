# Project Overview

In this project we demonstrate a basic ETL workflow by extracting data from https://www.transfermarkt.us/ via webscraping (beautifulsoup), transforming and preparing this data via pandas, and loading it into a PostSQL relational database for later access. 

## The included files (Club, Player, League Extracts) each scrape data from the website. 
Leagues Export v4.ipynb - Scrapes data from the top 25 leagues in Europe. 
Clubs Export v4.ipynb - Scrapes data from all clubs in those top 25 leagues. 
Players Export v4.ipynb - Scrapes data from all clubs in those top 25 leagues.
